# Become a Digital Architect through the Creation Virtual Reality Worlds
*A TAU VR and Washington Leadership Academy collaboration*

## Introduction
Eventhough WebVR (Virtual Reality that be be seen from a website) is still in its early stages of development, it still provides access for you to create content on Virtual Reality devices, such as the Oculus Rift, Google Daydream, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, or the Google Cardboard, in your web browser. 

[A-Frame](http://aframe.io "A-Frame Homepage") is an open-source web framework for building virtual reality experiences for the browser. We can build VR web pages that users can walk into with just HTML.

## Why Use A-Frame?

A-Frame makes VR more accessible since you can develop and render VR experiences in the browser as opposed to needing resource heavy platforms such as Unity. This is especially important for schools with limited technology where student devices have limited graphics capabilities or inexpensive devices, like Chromebooks, are not only more common but necessary to fit budget constraints ([you can't install Unity on Chromebooks](https://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements "Unity System Requirements")).

A-Frame is also an easy leap for students who have already been introduced to basic HTML. There are definitely a number of other WebVR frameworks and tools to use, but my teacher personal preference is to get kids to write code and A-Frame currently fits that need.
